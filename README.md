# CliqueVM

<img src="screenshot.jpg" width="512"><br/>

**CliqueVM** is an experimental framework for building computational models,
both classical and quantum mechanical, and tracing their multithreaded
evolution as 2D/3D graphs. New models can be coded in JavaScript directly on
the app by modifying the operator function that maps a clique of states
into a new generation of states.

**Run online: https://met4citizen.github.io/CliqueVM/**

The purpose of the project is NOT to make an app for practical simulations,
but to study the underlying concepts and ideas.

The app uses [@hpcc-js/wasm](https://github.com/hpcc-systems/hpcc-js-wasm)
for compiling [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org) DOT language into SVG,
[3d Force-Directed Graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph)
for rendering 3D graphs and [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net) as
a JavaScript editor.

The project is based on my two earlier projects
[Hypergraph](https://github.com/met4citizen/Hypergraph) and
[BigraphQM](https://github.com/met4citizen/BigraphQM).
For a philosophical take on these ideas read the blog post
[The Game of Algorithms](https://metacity.blogspot.com).


## Introduction

All physical systems evolve over time. We can represent this with
a mathematical object called an operator that maps the state of the system
at time $t$ into another state at $t+1$. When we run this operator
iteratively, we get a computational object called a program, a sequence
of operations, acting on states.

Often the system has so many possible states that it is very hard or
impossible to describe the operator. Fortunately, all physical interactions
are, as far as we know, spacelike and local. This means that instead
of acting on the full state of the system we can process smaller collections
of microstates independently of each other. We call these collections cliques,
because they show up as maximal cliques in our graphs.

For two programs to end up spacelike and local, their computational
histories must be mutually consistent and they must compute the same function.
More specifically, their lowest common ancestors (LCAs) must be operations,
not states, and they have to belong to the same equivalence class
of programs. Both of these properties are relative. If and when these
pairwise relations change, we end up with not one but multiple threads
that can branch, merge and run in parallel.

A multithreaded system, real or simulated, can be classical, quantum
mechanical, or some mix of the two, depending on the operator. The thing
that makes a system quantum mechanical is the existence of superpositions.
A quantum superposition is a situation in which some computational sequence $A$
is pairwise consistent with both $B$ and
$C$, but
$B$ and
$C$ are not consistent with each other. Graph-theoretically these are
called open triplets. They are second-order inconsistencies that break local
classical states into two or more overlapping maximal cliques.

Once we know how to calculate these maximal cliques, we can use them as
inputs to our operator function, iterate the process, and trace the system's
multithreaded evolution with a pre-defined set of graph-based tools.
All this can be done within the app.

CliqueVM is called a framework, because it allows us to define, among others,
our own initial state, operator and equivalence relation. By using JavaScript's
primitive types, such as numbers, strings, arrays and objects, we can construct
hyperedges, vectors, complex numbers, matrices, coordinate systems etc.
Using these data structures as states, it is possible, at least in theory,
to build different types of rewriting systems, physical simulations
and other computational models.


## Theory

Let $H$ be a 3-partite directed acyclic graph (DAG) with the following three
parts: operations $V_o$,
states $V_s$, and
maximal cliques $V_c$.

$\displaystyle\qquad H= (V_o \cup V_s \cup V_c, E),\quad E\subseteq (V_o{\times}V_s)\cup (V_s{\times}V_c)\cup (V_c{\times}V_o)$

At each new step, the latest set of maximal cliques, $L_c$, is used as an input
for the operator $\hat{M}$, which maps each clique into a new generation
of operations and output states.

$\displaystyle\qquad L_c=\big\lbrace v \in V_c\mid\mathbf{deg^+} (v)=0 \big\rbrace$

$\displaystyle\qquad \hat{M}: L_c\longrightarrow (V_o \cup V_s, E),\quad E\subseteq V_o{\times}V_s$

In order to calculate the new generation of maximal cliques, we start from
the latest operator-generated states $L_s$. Two states are local and spacelike
if and only if they are equivalent $\sim$ and their
[lowest common ancestors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor)
(LCAs) are operations. Let an undirected graph $G$ track all such pairs.

$\displaystyle\qquad L_s=\big\lbrace v \in V_s\mid\mathbf{deg^+} (v)=0 \big\rbrace$

$\displaystyle\qquad G= (L_s, E),\quad E = \big\lbrace (a,b)\mid a\sim b\wedge\mathbf{LCA}_H(a,b)\subset V_o\big\rbrace$

Now, let $\Omega$ be one of the disconnected subgraphs in
$G$. In order to find its maximal cliques, we use a variant of the
[Bron-Kerbosch algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bron–Kerbosch_algorithm).
The algorithm has the worst-case time complexity $O(3^{n\over 3})$ and for
[k-degenerate graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_%28graph_theory%29)
$O(kn3^\frac{k}{3})$.

$\displaystyle\qquad\mathcal{F} = \mathbf{BK}(\varnothing,\Omega,\varnothing)$

```
ALGORITHM BK(R, P, X) IS
    IF P and X are both empty THEN
        report R as a maximal clique
    choose a pivot vertex u in P ⋃ X
    FOR each vertex v in P \ N(u) DO
        BK(R ⋃ {v}, P ⋂ N(v), X ⋂ N(v))
        P := P \ {v}
        X := X ⋃ {v}
```

Once all the maximal cliques of all the disconnected subgraphs have been
calculated, a new iteration (step) can be started.

If the operator is deterministic, the system, too, will be deterministic.
However, if the operator generates more that one operation, even
a deterministic system can become quantum mechanical. In these cases
the evolution will appear probabilistic to any internal observer due to
self-locating uncertainty.

Under self-locating uncertainty, an observation becomes a process
in which the observer interacts locally in a way that resolves
all the second-order inconsistencies (superpositions). These
interactions make new shortcuts through the ancestral structure. This
in turn prevents certain future interactions, which appears to the internal
observer as a wave-function collapse.

From the internal observer's point of view, the proportion of all
the possible
[Hamiltonian paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path)
that lead to the maximal clique $\mathcal{F_i}\in\mathcal{F}$ is
the probability $p_i$ of that outcome.

$\displaystyle\qquad p_i={{|\mathcal{F_i}|!}\over{\sum\limits_{j} |\mathcal{F_j}|!}},\quad i\in \lbrace 1,\dots,|\mathcal{F}| \rbrace$

Note that from the external point of view - from "the point of nowhere" - all
the possible interactions get actualised without any randomness or
probabilities. In this context, often called the Many-Worlds
interpretation, $p_i$ can be seen as the path weight.


## Graphs

The framework offers the following graph-based views:

VIEW | DESCRIPTION
:-: | :--
<sup>Trace</sup><br/>![](img/trace.svg) | Multithread trace views the evolution of the system as a directed acyclic graph. Option `Full` shows the full 3-partite DAG with local spacetime clusters. Option `Cliques` shows cliques and local clusters ignoring operations and states. Option `Locs` shows only spacetime locations and their spatial coordinates.
<sup>Snap</sup><br/>![](img/snap.svg) | Snapshot (hypersurface/foliation) of the multithread trace at the current step. Option `States` shows the snapshot at the level of states. Two states are connected if they are local and consistent (spacelike) relative to each other. Option `Cliques` shows the snapshot at the level of cliques. Two cliques are connected if they overlap, that is, share common states. Option `Locs` shows the snapshot at the level of locations. Two locations are connected if they have an immediate parent location.
<sup>Space</sup><br/>![](img/space.svg) | Spatial 3D projection of the evolution. Each node represents a spatial coordinate. Two coordinates are connected with an undirected edge when one of them has been a direct parent of another. Option `Paths` shows the relative density of operations leading to each coordinate at the current step. Option `Action` shows the relative density calculated over time starting from the initial state.
<sup>Hits</sup><br/>![](img/hits.svg) | Detector hit counts as a bar chart. Option `Step` shows the number of hits at the current step. Option `Total` shows the total count starting from the initial state.

The previous or the next step can be calculated by clicking the arrows.
`Reset` returns the model to its initial state. `Cancel` aborts current
processing and cancel the job queue.


## Models

By clicking `Model`, the user can specify his own model, deploy the model,
and export/import models as JSON strings.

A model is a set of JavaScript functions:

The `INITIAL STATE` returns an array of initial states. A state can be
any valid JavaScript data structure. An example:

```javascript
/**
/* @return {any[]} Array of initial states.
**/
return [1];
```

The `OPERATOR` gets a maximal clique (array of states) as its input
and returns an array of operations so that each operation is an array of
output states. An example:

```javascript
/**
* @param {any[]} c Clique, array of input states
* @return {any[][]} New operations with output states.
**/
let sum = c.reduce((a,b)=>a+b,0);
let state1 = (2*sum+3) % 10;
let state2 = (3*sum+1) % 7;
let operation1 = [ state1, state2 ];
return [ operation1 ];
```

The `COORDINATE / EQUIVALENCE` gets a state as its input and returns its
coordinate label as a string. The coordinate label is used to test whether
two states are equivalent (local). This state equivalence could also be seen
as an observer-theoretic coarse-graining and/or encoding function. An example:

```javascript
/**
* @param {any} s State
* @return {string} Spatial coordinate.
**/
return s.toString();
```

The `VISIBILITY` gets a state as its input and returns `true` or `false`
depending on whether the state is to be shown or not. Note: This doesn't
affect the processing, only how the states get visualised. An example:

```javascript
/**
* @param {any} s State
* @return {boolean} true, if the state is to be shown.
**/
return true;
```

The `DETECTORS` returns an array of coordinates to be monitored. Whenever some
detector state is visited at some step, its counter is increased. An example:

```javascript
/**
* @return {string[]} Array of detector coordinates.
**/
return ['0','1','2','3','4'];
```

All functions get executed with the "use strict" directive.

**NOTE:** The JavaScript source code in the JSON string is used to
create a new `Function` object inside a Web Worker. This means
that the code will have no DOM access and critical issues such as
infinite loops can be easily solved by terminating the worker (reset).
However, for security reasons, always check the model before importing!


## Model API

In order to keep the functions short, the framework offers a simple API
(`ModelAPI` class) with a set of commonly used utility functions and
generators. In the app these methods can be called with `this`, for
example: `this.id()`.

FUNCTION| DESCRIPTION
:-- | :--
<nobr>`id()`</nobr> | Returns a new unique number from [0,1,2,3...]. Reseting the model also resets the id counter.
<nobr>`set(key,value)`</nobr> | Set option. Currently supports the following keys: `observer` (1=quantum, 2=classic), `maxcliquesperloc` (number) and `maxstatesperclique` (number).
<nobr>`get(key)`</nobr> | Get option value.
<nobr>`clone(x)`</nobr> | Makes a deep copy of the given data structure.
<nobr>`shuffle(arr)`</nobr> | Shuffles an array in place using the Fisher-Yates shuffle.
<nobr>`*comb(arr,[size])`</nobr> | Generates all combinations of a set. `size` is the length of the combination. An example:<br/>`comb([a,b,c],2)` -> `[a,b] [a,c] [b,c]`
<nobr>`*perm(arr,[size])`</nobr> | Generates all permutations of a set. `size` is the length of the permutation. An example:<br/>`perm([a,b,c],2)` -> `[a,b] [a,c] [b,a] [b,c] [c,a] [c,b]`
<nobr>`*cart(...sets)`</nobr> | Generates the cartesian product of the given sets. An example:<br/>`cart([a,b],[c,d,e])` -> `[a,c] [a,d] [a,e] [b,c] [b,d] [b,e]`
<nobr>`BronKerbosch(V,N)`</nobr> | Finds maximal cliques of the set `V` using the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm. `N` is a WeakMap of neighbours for each vertex.
<nobr>`rewriteStr(s,rules)`</nobr> | Rewrite string `s` with `rules`. Return all overlapping maximal results. For example:<br/> `rewriteStr('BAA',[['BA','AB'],['A','C']])` -> `['BCC', 'ABC']`.

**TODO:** Add utility functions for typical use cases such as graph rewriting.


## Server (EXPERIMENTAL)

By default, the model is computed in your browser using Web Worker threads.
However, it is also possible to compute the model on an external WebSocket
server.

In order to run the server, install
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download), clone the project, and install:

```
git clone https://github.com/met4citizen/CliqueVM.git
cd CliqueVM/server
npm install
```

There are two types of servers: a single server `server.mjs` and a distributed
server `serverd.mjs`. The single server computes the whole model in one
instance. Distributed servers compute only cliques, but unlike in the single
server architecture, you can run and utilize several server instances, each
running on a different computer.

If you want to use the single server architecture, start the server with
the following command:

```
node server.mjs --cert=/path/server.crt --key=/path/server.key --port=8880
```

Alternatively, if you want to use the distributed architecture, run the
following command on each computer in your computer clusters:

```
node serverd.mjs --cert=/path/server.crt --key=/path/server.key --port=8881
```

PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION
:-- | :--
`cert` | SSL certificate file. If not specified, SSL is not used.
`key` | SSL certificate key file. If not specified, SSL is not used.
`port` | Server port. Default port is `8880` for single server and `8881` for distributed servers.
`threads` | Number of threads used for computing the model from 1 to the number of CPU cores. Default is the number of CPU cores.

Once the server/servers is/are running, open CliqueVM page, click `Server`
on toolbar, specify your server URL(s), and click the check box next to it to
enable.

Notes:

- If you run the server over SSL, use protocol `wss` on the URL, e.g. `wss://<domain.com>:8880/`.
- If you run the server without SSL, use protocol `ws` on the URL, e.g. `ws://<domain.com>:8880/`.
- If you run CliqueVM over HTTPS, but the server without SSL, you need to allow insecure content from your browser's settings (not recommended).
- If you use a self-signed certificate on your server, you might need to first open the HTTPS page, e.g. "https://<domain.com>:8880/", on your browser to accept the certificate.
